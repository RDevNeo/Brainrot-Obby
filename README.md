# Brainrot Obby

### The workspace's code are minimal, if not no-existent, i try to not code there.

The game consist in a mixture of types of famous games/themes in roblox, such as Obby, Pets, Brainrots and Rebirths.

The main idea was to combine everything together and mixture all in a fun and vicious game, where the players can play for a long time and actually gave fun with it. I didn't want to make the game Pay to Win, but I've added some passes that are kinda broken and probably in the future ill remove them. Even with the passes the player will keep playing the game.

With sounds of the Brainrots I could be able to make the game a little more addicted and funny, of course, the game is for kids, and one of the best way to don't lose their attentions is to make video and sounds effects. 

The first release was in: 08/20/2025, I, Igor, have developed the entire game with AI assistant me in the mid process towards the end of it. Above will have the link of the game that you can check, play and have a bit of fun.
